I am an actor, singer, and computer geek from **Omaha, Nebraska**. I enjoy performing musicals and plays in facilities such as the Omaha Community Playhouse, the Rose Blumpkin Theater, the JCC, and the Chanticleer Theater. I attend school at Omaha Central High and am a sophomore. I love experimenting with computers, particularly in the area of machine learning as it combines the mathematical and binary worlds. I am Jewish and have 4 other siblings.

Here is an interesting photo taken of some of my family for an experiment my mother's friend was doing with old fashion photography.
